Highlights

- Dimensional Landauer bound extends Landauer to continuous dimensional reduction.
- Geometric cost C_Φ depends on the projection Jacobian and manifold curvature.
- Curved-manifold confinement costs scale with mean-squared curvature ⟨κ²⟩.
- Kuramoto synchronization lowers projection cost by collapsing effective dimension.
- Autoencoder bottlenecks and field coupling show sharp cost crossovers and slaving.
