Highlights

- We derive the Dimensional Landauer Bound extending classical bit erasure to continuous dimensional reduction on strange attractors

- The geometric cost C_Φ is governed by the Jacobian determinant and manifold curvature, linking effective dimension to thermodynamic work

- Kuramoto oscillators exhibit a synchronization transition: coherence spontaneously reduces the geometric work of dimensional readout

- Autoencoder training shows a sharp crossover with divergent work below the data's intrinsic dimension

- Synergetic self-organization (Haken's slaving principle) provides a thermodynamic mechanism for efficient biological computation
